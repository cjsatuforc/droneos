After installing Raspbian image, and connect the Raspberry Pi with an output screen to get an interface.
Connecting Raspberry Pi with your computer system, steps are:
1- Connect Tp-link to one of the USB port.
2- Run the commnads from the Terminal
   ping (IP address of RPi) #ip address can be taken from the wifi devices connected to your internet
   When the data packets are received,
   ssh pi@(IP address)
3- Enter the RPi password.

Now you are in your Raspberry Pi system.

Install Pyck, GPSD, GPIO modules.
